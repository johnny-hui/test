What is a migration?
    - A migration is when the model in your application is used to automatically produce commands that create 
      the database & tables in SQL server. (noSQL approach)
      
            - Buttons in the the "Edit", "Create", "Delete" views are mapped to SQL commands.

Things we did for this lab:
    - We are using Entity Framework Core to inject our Models as entities in our database (SQL-Lite).

    - We then used a Code Generator to generate our Views and Controllers for our entities(models).
